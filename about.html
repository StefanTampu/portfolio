                <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>
                <p>Since graduating high school in 2015, I have studied history at university, taught math in middle & high school, and am now looking to expand my jack-of-all-trades repertoire by launching into web development. I have worked through courses on <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> and <span>JavaScript</span> and personal projects for the web since 2022, and I am now expanding my skills in <span>SEO</span> and <span>UX/UI</span>.</p>
                <h3><span>Vision:</span> To build websites that are both simple and beautiful, working to support your business and draw in customers.</h3>
                <h3><span>Mission:</span> To work with you to deliver websites that streamline your business - not complicate it!</h3>
                <p>Often a website can be just an extra expense for a business. Instead, I wish to consult closely with you to understand what your problems and needs are. The goal is to create a site that takes a load off your hands, and brings in the customers you want. In other words, let's talk, <span>and see how a web site can be a helpful tool for you!</span></p>
